# Matlab-Garch_Analysis
### File: Matlab & Garch_Analysis.pdf is the write-up 
### File: midterm_main is the file where I used different Garch Models for return series and conducted the whole Estimation analysis process
### File: Copy_of_main_11 is the main file for estimation of Garch(p,q)
### File: Copy_of_main is the main file for estimation of Garch(1,1)
### File: Garch_LL_func is the file for likelihood function of Garch(p,q)
### File: Garch_LL_func_11 is the file for likelihood function of Garch(1,1)
